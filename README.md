# Fast-TauCC

This is a python implementation of algorithm PrototypeBased-tauTCC. The algorithm performs Co-clustering on positive real-valued matrices and tensors.

The main code is in folder algorithms. Use files 'CoClust_real_data.py' and 'CoClust_3D_real_data.py' for a demo on, respectively, matrices and 3-way tensors.
